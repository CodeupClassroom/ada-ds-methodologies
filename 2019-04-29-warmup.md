# Warmup

It's another day at the office at Big Research Co &trade;. You look up from your
laptop and see a woman in a lab coat standing in front of your desk.

"I need some help" she says. "We lost some subjects from the trial."

She notices a curious look on your face. "Not like that, they just ran away.
We didn't lock the doors soon enough."

"Anyway, there's probably like a 70%, no maybe 80%, no, let's say 90% chance
that a given subject will stick around, and I need to run the study again with
10, or 20 subjects. We need to gather enough data on them to justify the cost,
so I need you to figure out what are the probabilities are that at least half of
them stick around, only 1 person leaves, and that all the subjects stay."

She sees you start to form another question and cuts you off.

"Don't ask. You *really* don't want to know."

---

- What probability distribution would you use to model the scenario outlined
  above?
- Calculate all the requested probabilities. Use all the possible combinations
  of subject count and chance that a subject will stay in the study.
- **Bonus**: visualize the requested probabilities.

## Hints

- Use `scipy.stats` for this.
- A fancy list comprehension or the `itertools` module can help you find
  all the possible combinations.
- Each distribution has a cumulative density function that tells you the
  likelihood that a value falls at or below a given point.
- Consider storing the results of your calculations in a data frame.

```python
import itertools as it
from scipy import stats
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

ps = [.7, .8, .9]
ns = [10, 20]
ks = range(20)

cdfs = [(p, n, k, stats.binom.cdf(n=n, p=p, k=k)) for p, n, k in it.product(ps, ns, ks)]
df = pd.DataFrame(cdfs, columns=['p', 'n', 'k', 'cdf(k)'])
df.loc[(df.n == 10) & (df.k > 10), 'cdf(k)'] = np.nan
df.dropna(inplace=True)

sns.relplot(data=df, x='k', y='cdf(k)', hue='p', col='n', kind='line')
